# There are two windows in python IDLE
# IDLE is an IDE (Integrated Developement Environment)
# It is used to edit and output your code 
# A good example of IDEs is VS Code 
# These IDEs usually have two windows
# The Editor window and the Shell window
# The Editor window is where you "edit" and save your code
# Whereas the shell window can be used to write and output your code it does not save your code 
# So all your variables and code is lost once you close it 
# The Shell window does have a use though, as it can be used to test/run small snippets of your code
# To make sure it is running well

# An important feature in Python is indentaton
if 2 > 5:
    print("This is false")
#^^^ This is indentation it is used so that python knows when and where your "if" statements and "while" loops 
# start and end,  They also make your code easier to read or understand for both you to read back and check
# but for other people reviewing your code.
# Indentation in pyton is usually four spaces or 1 tab but they can be anything you like as long as they are consistent
