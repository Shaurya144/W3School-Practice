# Print is often used to display things onto the terminal or for the reader to read
text = "Python is awesome"
print(text) # prints text

# you can also print multiple variables and seperate them with a comma 
x = "Hello"
y = "Good"
z = "Bye"
print(x, y, z)

# You can also use "+" to add these variables together
print(x + y + z)

# ^ you might notice that there is no space between them this is because due to the space Python doesn't 
# automatically add the space 

# When printing you can't print two variables of different data types or else you will get an error
t = 5
name = "Hello"
print(str(t) + name) # so you have to use casting
