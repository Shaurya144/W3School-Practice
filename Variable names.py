# in python you can create a variable just by assigning a vallue to it
x = 5
y = 6
print(x + y)

# Casting is when you change the Data Type of a variable to another data type
z = float(x)

# Variables are case sensitive 
a = 20
A = 15
# ^ These are two different variables

# A string can be either " " double quotes or '' single quotes
b = "21"
b = '21' # same thing

# Variable Names Rules

"""
Variable names must start with a letter or underscore and cannot be a number
Variable names can only contain Alpha-numeric character (A-z, 0-9 and _)
Variable cannot be any of Python's key words (if, then, else, or)
